## Link Building Fundamentals

### Why Links Matter

Links serve as "votes of confidence" from other websites. Quality matters more than quantity:

- **Relevance**: Link from related site/page
- **Authority**: Link from trusted domain
- **Context**: Editorial link within content
- **Traffic potential**: Could send actual visitors

### Link Attributes

**Follow vs. Nofollow:**
- `rel="follow"` (default): Passes PageRank
- `rel="nofollow"`: Tells Google not to pass PageRank
- `rel="sponsored"`: Identifies paid links
- `rel="ugc"`: User-generated content links

**Note**: Google treats these as "hints" not directives. Even nofollow links can have value for discovery and traffic.

### Anchor Text Types

| Type | Example | Best Practice |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Exact match | "SEO services" | Use sparingly—can look manipulative |
| Partial match | "best SEO services in NYC" | Good balance of signal and natural |
| Branded | "Acme Inc" | Safe and natural |
| Naked URL | "https://example.com" | Natural, common |
| Generic | "click here", "read more" | Limited value but natural |
| Image (alt text) | [image alt="SEO guide"] | Ensure descriptive alt |

**Natural anchor text distribution:**
- Mostly branded + naked URLs
- Some partial match
- Few exact match
- Some generic

## Link Quality Assessment

### Quick Evaluation Checklist

Before pursuing a link opportunity, ask:

**Relevance:**
- [ ] Is the site topically related to my site?
- [ ] Does the specific page context make sense?
- [ ] Would their audience find my content valuable?

**Authority:**
- [ ] Does the site have real traffic?
- [ ] Does it have legitimate backlinks itself?
- [ ] Is the domain established (not brand new)?

**Trust signals:**
- [ ] Real editorial standards (not accepting anything)?
- [ ] No obvious link schemes?
- [ ] Legitimate contact information?
- [ ] Active, updated content?

**Red flags:**
- [ ] Pages with 50+ outbound links
- [ ] "Write for us" pages with no quality standards
- [ ] Sites with irrelevant content topics mixed
- [ ] Excessive ads, poor design
- [ ] Obvious PBN patterns

### Metrics to Consider

| Metric | Tool | What It Indicates |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Domain Authority/Rating | Moz/Ahrefs | Overall domain strength |
| Page Authority | Moz | Specific page strength |
| Traffic estimate | Ahrefs/SEMrush | Real audience size |
| Referring domains | Any backlink tool | How many sites link here |
| Spam score | Moz | Risk indicator |

**Caution**: Don't rely solely on metrics. A relevant DR40 site may be more valuable than an irrelevant DR70 site.

### Link Value Hierarchy

1. Editorial mentions from major publications
2. Resource page links from .edu/.gov
3. Industry-leading blog features
4. Relevant high-authority sites

**Good value:**
5. Guest posts on quality sites
6. Industry directory listings
7. Relevant blog comments (with real engagement)
8. Social media profiles

11. Low-quality directories
12. Article directories
