| Value | Will ranking drive business outcomes? |

### Step 4: Keyword Grouping

**Group keywords by:**
- Topic clusters (pillar + supporting)

- Funnel stage (awareness, consideration, decision)
- Content type needed (blog, landing page, product page)

## Search Intent Deep Dive

### The Four Intent Types

#### 1. Informational Intent
**User goal**: Learn something, find an answer

**Signals:**
- Question words (how, what, why, when)
- Educational terms (guide, tutorial, tips)

**Content formats:**

- Guides and tutorials
- Videos
- Infographics
- FAQs

**Examples:**
- "how to tie a tie"

- "best practices for email marketing"

#### 2. Navigational Intent
**User goal**: Find a specific website or page

**Signals:**
- Brand names
- Specific product/service names
- "login", "homepage", "official"

**Content formats:**
- Homepage
- Product pages
- About/Contact pages

**Examples:**
- "Facebook login"
- "Apple store"
- "HubSpot pricing"

#### 3. Commercial Investigation Intent
**User goal**: Research before a purchase decision

**Signals:**
- "best", "top", "review"
- "vs", "comparison", "alternative"
- Year modifiers ("best laptop 2024")

**Content formats:**
- Comparison posts
- Review roundups
- "Best of" lists
- Product comparisons

**Examples:**

#### 4. Transactional Intent

**Signals:**
- "buy", "purchase", "order"
- "discount", "coupon", "deal"
- "near me", "delivery"
- Product-specific searches

**Content formats:**

- Service pages
- Landing pages
- Checkout flows

**Examples:**

- "Nike Air Max discount"
- "SEO agency pricing"

### Intent Validation via SERP Analysis

**Before creating content, analyze what Google shows:**

1. Search the keyword in incognito
2. Note the result types:
   - Organic listings (what content types?)
   - Featured snippets (what format?)
   - Shopping results (commercial intent)
   - Local pack (local intent)
   - Video carousel (video content preferred)
   - Images (visual content important)

3. Click top 3-5 results:
   - What format are they?
   - How comprehensive?
   - What subtopics covered?
   - What do they miss?

**If SERP shows different intent than expected, trust the SERP.**

## Competitive Analysis

### Identifying SEO Competitors

**SEO competitors ≠ business competitors**

Find SEO competitors by:
1. Search your target keywords
2. Note which sites consistently appear
3. These are your SEO competitors for these topics

### Competitor Keyword Gap Analysis

**Process:**

1. **Identify top 3-5 SEO competitors**
   - Search core keywords
   - Note recurring domains

2. **Extract their organic keywords**
   - Use Ahrefs/SEMrush
   - Or manually review their content

3. **Find gaps**
   - Keywords they rank for, you don't
   - Topics they cover, you haven't

4. **Prioritize opportunities**
   ```
   Priority Score = (Volume × Relevance) / Difficulty
   ```

### Content Gap Prioritization Matrix

| | Low Difficulty | High Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| **High Volume** | Quick wins - Do first | Strategic - Plan carefully |
| **Low Volume** | Long-tail opportunities | Likely skip |

### Competitor Content Analysis

**For each competitive piece, note:**
- Word count and depth
- Subtopics covered
- Content format (list, guide, video, etc.)
- Unique value provided
- Backlink profile
- Publication/update date
- User engagement signals

## Content Planning

### Topic Cluster Model

**Structure:**

```
                    Pillar Page

                         │
    ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
    │                    │                    │
    ▼                    ▼                    ▼
Cluster Page 1      Cluster Page 2      Cluster Page 3
(Subtopic)          (Subtopic)          (Subtopic)
    │                    │                    │
    ├── Supporting       ├── Supporting       ├── Supporting
    └── Supporting       └── Supporting       └── Supporting

   - New questions to answer

4. **Update content**

   - Improve depth where needed
   - Refresh images/media
   - Update publication date (with "updated" note)

5. **Re-optimize**

6. **Re-promote**

### Content Pruning

**When to remove/consolidate content:**

3. **Noindex**: Keep page but remove from search
4. **Delete**: Remove entirely (use 410, not 404)
